# 📦 Warehouse Management System

A Java-based desktop application for managing warehouse inventory, tracking product expiration, and organizing stock movement — built with Swing and a sleek, user-friendly GUI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add, update, or remove products from stock
- 📆 Track product expiration dates
- 🧾 Custom-designed GUI using Java Swing
- 🔐 Includes sign-in/sign-up screen (basic, not security-enforced)
- 📊 Generate stock and sales reports
- 🧍 Role-limited interface: admin and employee access (UI-only separation)

---

## ⚠️ Note on Access Control

While the application includes a sign-in and sign-up interface, it **does not enforce backend authentication**. Users can technically bypass login by running the main file directly (`finish.java`). This feature is currently UI-only.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 11
- Swing (GUI)
- IntelliJ IDEA (project environment)

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abood190-c/Warehouse-Management-System.git
2. Open in IntelliJ or your favorite IDE.
3. Run the sign.java file inside src/gui (or) src/gui/finish.java directly to skip sign-in.

Coming soon — GUI previews will be added.
